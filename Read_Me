This final project is a tarot reading with sensor inputs displayed onto an FHD display screen.

The input uses 2 ultrasonic sensors to detect the distance away an object is from them. Whenever an object is within 0.2 feet away from the sensors, the code recieves an input.
A tarot deck is split into 2 types of cards, major arcana and minor arcana. Major arcana are used to show major events in ones life, and minor arcana show smaller events.
Each sensor is linked up with one of the dictionaries used to store the cards information, one sensor for the major arcana, and one sensor for the minor arcana.
